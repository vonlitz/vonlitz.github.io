            <p><h3>Arctic Monkeys</h3>
            are an English rock band formed in Sheffield in 2002.
            They comprise lead singer and guitarist Alex Turner, drummer Matt Helders, guitarist Jamie Cook and bassist Nick O'Malley.
            The co-founder and original bassist Andy Nicholson left in 2006.
            Though initially associated with the short-lived landfill indie movement,[2] Arctic Monkeys were one of the earliest bands to come to public attention via the Internet, during the emerging "blog rock"[3] era.
            Commentators have suggested that this period marked a shift in how new bands were promoted and marketed.[4]

            <p>
            Their debut album, Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not (2006), received acclaim and topped the UK Albums Chart, becoming the fastest-selling debut album in British chart history at the time.
            It won Best British Album at the 2007 Brit Awards and has been hailed as one of the greatest debut albums.
            [5] The band's second album, Favourite Worst Nightmare (2007), was also acclaimed and won Best British Album at the 2008 Brit Awards.
            Humbug (2009) and Suck It and See (2011) received positive but weaker reviews.

            <h3>In the United Kingdom,</h3>
            Arctic Monkeys became the first independent-label band to debut at number one in the UK with their first five albums.
            [8] They have won seven Brit Awards, winning Best British Group and British Album of the Year three times,
            becoming the first band to ever "do the double"—that is, win in both categories—three times; a Mercury Prize for Whatever People Say I Am,
            That's What I'm Not; an Ivor Novello Award and 20 NME Awards. They have been nominated for nine Grammy Awards,
            [9] and received Mercury Prize nominations in 2007, 2013, 2018 and 2023.
            [10] Both Whatever People Say I Am, That's What I'm Not and AM are included in NME and different editions of Rolling Stone's lists of the "500 Greatest Albums of All Time".
